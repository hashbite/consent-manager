# Translation and Internationalization Support

Consent Manager is designed to work seamlessly with widely-used React translation libraries such as react-i18n, react-intl, LinguiJS, and more. 

If you opt to create your own interface, you have complete flexibility in managing translations and internationalization. However, for those utilizing our default interface, comprehensive i18n support is already integrated. For detailed guidance on implementing i18n with the default interface, please refer to our [i18n guide for the default interface](../interface-default/i18n.md).
