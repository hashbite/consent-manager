## What is this about?


<YouTube id="OFRjZtYs3wY" />

We want to make the web less messy. And especially more fair, for website owners and the end users.

We hope that this framework enables other developers to create a good, fair and usefull consent management experience.
Our goal is to enable other React developers to get compliant with the new [General Data Protection Regulation
 (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) from Europe.

## Why only React?

Because React is our home, we welcome people from other communites.
