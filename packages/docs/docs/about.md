# Welcome to Consent Manager

Consent Manager is an intuitive React-based toolkit crafted to seamlessly incorporate external services into web applications while strictly adhering to GDPR and various other data privacy regulations. Our tool streamlines the process of managing user consent for data processing and interactions with third-party services.

## Our Mission

Our aim is to declutter the web, making it a fairer space for both website owners and end-users, in line with GDPR and other data privacy laws.

### User-Centric Data Privacy

We prioritize user privacy by default. For instance, consider our handling of embeds like this:

<YoutubeVideo id="OFRjZtYs3wY" />

Users see a placeholder first, safeguarding their data. They can enable the YouTube integration with a single click on this placeholder or by clicking the shield icon üõ°Ô∏è at the bottom left corner.

### Customizable for Your Needs

While the default interface of Consent Manager offers swift integration, it's fully customizable. Adapt its styling or craft your own interface to meet your project's unique requirements and design.

### Empowering Developers

Consent Manager is more than a tool; it's a commitment to ethical, user-centric web experiences. Our goal is to empower React developers to easily align with the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) and similar laws, fostering a more secure and privacy-respecting digital world.

## Why React?

React is where we excel. However, we warmly welcome developers from all backgrounds and communities to explore and benefit from our toolkit.
