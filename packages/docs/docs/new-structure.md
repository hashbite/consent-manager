* home - introduction about the how and why

* tutorials
  * quick start - default interface with one integration
    * highlight features
    * show how to add addons, based on one example (matomo or google docs?)
    * offer next steps:
  * how to track and render while checking for user consent
  * Style default interface
  * i18n integration of default interface (translate default interface)
  * Implement your own interface
  * Create a custom tracking integration 

* integrations
  * make more examples on how to track with certain integrations (for example matomo track events, page view and so on)
  * make sure all config options are listed



* other todos
  * maybe its the way we store the tracking in our hooks @stanford & @maneframe why tracking stays active even when user denies (set reference of object ot null is not acutally deleting the object from ram?)
  * actively ask for co contributors in readme and on website
  * can we do some seo for our docs page?
