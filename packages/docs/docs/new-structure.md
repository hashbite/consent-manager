- home - introduction about the how and why

- tutorials
  - DONE - quick start - default interface with one integration
  - DONE - Style default interface
  - DONE - i18n integration of default interface (translate default interface)
  - DONE - Implement your own interface (demo/example already existing? show examples?)
  - DONE - Create a custom tracking integration
  - Frameworks: Basic tutorial + link to example
    - NextJS
    - Vite
    - Parcel
    - ~Create React App~
    - GatsbyJS
    - DocuSaurus
- DONE - @todo sub-section that turns all of this into typescript? (or have separate typescript tutorial?)
- DONE - @todo add another guide on how to handle tracking in single page applications (or ones that use routers)
- DONE - @todo we actually need to list the config options (COMPONENETS dir????)
- DONE - @todo document helper functions in core + default interface
- DONE - @todo document hooks in core + default interface
- @todo double check that we dont have no more "cosntruction" sites
- check again if we can add typescript related help into some guides or other parts of the docs
- integrations

  - make more examples on how to track with certain integrations (for example matomo track events, page view and so on)
  - make sure all config options are listed

- other todos
  - maybe its the way we store the tracking in our hooks @stanford & @maneframe why tracking stays active even when user denies (set reference of object ot null is not acutally deleting the object from ram?)
    - !!! we have to reload the page to be SURE that nothing is tracked anymore
  - actively ask for co contributors in readme and on website
  - DONE - can we do some seo for our docs page?
  - when linking hashbite, also offer payed services on a hourly rate
  - add google ads integration as we have it ready in @stanford
  - get rid of this file in the repo ;)
