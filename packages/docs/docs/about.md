# What is Consent Manager?

Welcome to Consent Manager ‚Äì an intuitive, React-based toolkit designed to seamlessly integrate external services into web applications, ensuring compliance with GDPR and various data privacy laws. Our solution simplifies managing user consent, streamlining data processing and interactions with third-party services while prioritizing user privacy and experience.

## Our Mission

Our aim is to declutter the web, making it a fairer space for both website owners and end-users, in line with GDPR and other data privacy laws.

### User-Centric Data Privacy

We prioritize user privacy by default. For instance, consider our handling of embeds like this:

<YoutubeVideo id="OFRjZtYs3wY" />

Users see a placeholder first, safeguarding their data. They can enable the YouTube integration with a single click on this placeholder or by clicking the shield icon üõ°Ô∏è at the bottom left corner.

### Unobtrusive Consent Experience: No Cookie Banner

Rather than confronting users with a large, page-covering cookie banner upon entry, Consent Manager introduces a more subtle and respectful way to manage settings.

The shield icon üõ°Ô∏è at the bottom left ensures ongoing accessibility without obstructing the user experience. A discreet notification is designed to appear only after 4 seconds of user inactivity, with all aspects being fully customizable.

### Customizable for Your Needs

While the default interface of Consent Manager offers swift integration, it's fully customizable. Adapt its styling or craft your own interface to meet your project's unique requirements and design.

### Empowering Developers

Consent Manager is more than a tool; it's a commitment to ethical, user-centric web experiences. Our goal is to empower React developers to easily align with the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) and similar laws, fostering a more secure and privacy-respecting digital world.

## Why React?

We specialize in React because it's our strength and passion. But we're excited about community efforts to extend Consent Manager's capabilities to other JavaScript front-end frameworks, making it universally accessible.
