* home - introduction about the how and why

* tutorials
  * DONE - quick start - default interface with one integration
  * DONE - Style default interface
  * DONE - i18n integration of default interface (translate default interface)
  * DONE - Implement your own interface (demo/example already existing? show examples?)
  * DONE - Create a custom tracking integration 
  * Frameworks: Basic tutorial + link to example
    * NextJS
    * Vite
    * Parcel
    * ~Create React App~
    * GatsbyJS
    * DocuSaurus
* @todo sub-section that turns all of this into typescript? (or have separate typescript tutorial?)
* @todo add another guide on how to handle tracking in single page applications (or ones that use routers)
* @todo we actually need to list the config options (COMPONENETS dir????)
* @todo document helper functions (getForegroundColor, createIconComponentFromSimpleIconsSvgPath)
* @todo double check that we dont have no more "cosntruction" sites
    
* integrations
  * make more examples on how to track with certain integrations (for example matomo track events, page view and so on)
  * make sure all config options are listed



* other todos
  * maybe its the way we store the tracking in our hooks @stanford & @maneframe why tracking stays active even when user denies (set reference of object ot null is not acutally deleting the object from ram?)
    * !!! we have to reload the page to be SURE that nothing is tracked anymore
  * actively ask for co contributors in readme and on website
  * DONE - can we do some seo for our docs page?
  * when linking hashbite, also offer payed services on a hourly rate
